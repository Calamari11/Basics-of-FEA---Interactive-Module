    "In general terms Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a numerical technique used to simulate the behavior of complex structures or systems by dividing them into smaller, manageable elements and solving equations for each element to approximate the overall behavior. FEA is incredibly versatile and can be used to solve for stresses, deformations, heat flow, fluid flow and many others.\n",

The main reason is that the load being applied is not accurately translating into the shear and bending stresses that would be observed in a real beam. This is a complex problem to model correctly and beyond the scope of this project but the point to take away is that FEA, while versatile and powerful, is not the best method in every scenario and is fully capable of outputting wildly incorrect results.
